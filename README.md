# CryptoTradingBot
The proposed structure for CryptoTradingBot.sln is a more modular and layered architecture that adheres to enterprise-grade software design principles. It aligns well with Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts by clearly separating concerns and responsibilities into distinct projects and layers.

Project References
To ensure proper communication between projects, the solution should have references configured as follows:

* CryptoTradingBot.Application depends on:
	* CryptoTradingBot.Core: For domain models, enums, and shared logic.
	* Abstractions (e.g., interfaces) defined in CryptoTradingBot.Infrastructure.

* CryptoTradingBot.Infrastructure depends on:
	* CryptoTradingBot.Core: For domain models, enums, and shared logic.

* CryptoTradingBot.Presentation depends on:
	* CryptoTradingBot.Application: For accessing application services.
	
	
Why This Structure Is Recommended
Separation of Concerns:

Each project is focused on a single responsibility: Application, Core, Infrastructure, and Presentation.
This makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and test.
Scalability:

The structure is highly modular, making it easier to scale the application by adding new features or layers (e.g., adding a WebAPI or another external integration).
Testability:

With clearly defined boundaries between projects, you can test each layer in isolation, improving test coverage and reliability.
Reusability:

Components like Core (domain models) and Infrastructure (API clients, database) can be reused across multiple projects or apps.
Alignment with Clean Architecture:

The Application Layer focuses on use cases and application logic.
The Core Layer contains the domain logic and is the most stable part of the system.
The Infrastructure Layer handles external dependencies like databases and APIs.
The Presentation Layer contains the UI (Console, Web, or Desktop).
Modifications Required to Align Your Project
1. Restructure Your Solution
Move your current files and folders into the new structure. Here’s how you can map your existing project to the new structure:

Current Folder/Feature	New Location
Logging (e.g., ILoggingService)	CryptoTradingBot.Application/Services
Binance API Client	CryptoTradingBot.Infrastructure/ApiIntegration/Binance/Clients
Binance Configuration	CryptoTradingBot.Infrastructure/ApiIntegration/Binance
Repositories (Database)	CryptoTradingBot.Infrastructure/Database
Domain Models (e.g., Trade)	CryptoTradingBot.Core/Models
Enum Types	CryptoTradingBot.Core/Enums
Custom Exceptions	CryptoTradingBot.Core/Exceptions
Console App Code	CryptoTradingBot.Presentation/ConsoleApp
WPF App Code	CryptoTradingBot.Presentation/DesktopApp


1. CryptoTradingBot.Core
Purpose: Contains the core business logic, domain models, and interfaces.
Dependencies: None (this project should be completely independent).
Content:
Entities: Define domain entities, such as Trade, Order, and Portfolio.
Value Objects: Define immutable value objects like Symbol, Price, or Amount.
Domain Events: Capture significant domain-level events (e.g., OrderExecutedEvent).
Interfaces: Declare repository and service abstractions (e.g., ITradeRepository).
Custom Exceptions: Define exceptions specific to the domain.
2. CryptoTradingBot.Application
Purpose: Orchestrates use cases and workflows using domain logic.
Dependencies:
Depends on CryptoTradingBot.Core.
Content:
Use Cases: Encapsulate application workflows (e.g., ExecuteTradeUseCase).
DTOs: Define data transfer objects for input/output (e.g., TradeDto).
Services: Define application services that implement workflows (e.g., TradeService).
Interfaces: Declare application-specific service abstractions.
3. CryptoTradingBot.Infrastructure
Purpose: Implements external dependencies like database access, API integrations, and configurations.
Dependencies:
Depends on CryptoTradingBot.Core.
Optionally depends on CryptoTradingBot.Application (if necessary).
Content:
Persistence: Implement repositories (e.g., TradeRepository for database interactions).
API Integrations: Implement clients for external services (e.g., Binance API client).
Configurations: Manage application configurations (e.g., appsettings.json readers).
Services: Implement infrastructure-specific services (e.g., logging or caching).
4. CryptoTradingBot.Presentation
Purpose: Handles the user interface and application entry points.
Dependencies:
Depends on CryptoTradingBot.Application.
Optionally depends on CryptoTradingBot.Infrastructure (if necessary for direct interactions).
Content:
ConsoleApp: Provides a command-line interface for testing or running the bot.
WebAPI: Exposes functionality via REST endpoints (optional, if you choose to implement a web interface).
DesktopApp: Implements a desktop interface (e.g., WPF or other GUI frameworks).
Multiple Subprojects: You may choose to separate Console, Web, and Desktop apps as subprojects under this layer.
Advantages of This Structure
Separation of Concerns:
Each layer has a clear responsibility, reducing coupling and improving maintainability.
Testability:
The Core and Application layers can be tested independently of the Infrastructure and Presentation layers.
Scalability:
Adding new features or integrating additional APIs becomes easier.
Reusability:
The Core and Application layers are reusable across different UI projects (e.g., WebAPI, ConsoleApp, DesktopApp).
Solution Structure Example
bash
Copy
Edit
CryptoTradingBot.sln
├── CryptoTradingBot.Core              # Business/domain logic
├── CryptoTradingBot.Application       # Application orchestration and use cases
├── CryptoTradingBot.Infrastructure    # External integrations, persistence, APIs
├── CryptoTradingBot.Presentation      # UI layer (ConsoleApp, WebAPI, DesktopApp)
Next Steps
Create the 4 projects: Add the projects to your solution using Visual Studio or your IDE of choice.

bash
Copy
Edit
dotnet new classlib -n CryptoTradingBot.Core
dotnet new classlib -n CryptoTradingBot.Application
dotnet new classlib -n CryptoTradingBot.Infrastructure
dotnet new console -n CryptoTradingBot.Presentation
Set dependencies: Add project references to ensure correct dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
dotnet add CryptoTradingBot.Application reference CryptoTradingBot.Core
dotnet add CryptoTradingBot.Infrastructure reference CryptoTradingBot.Core
dotnet add CryptoTradingBot.Presentation reference CryptoTradingBot.Application
dotnet add CryptoTradingBot.Presentation reference CryptoTradingBot.Infrastructure
Move your existing code into the respective layers:

Business logic and models → CryptoTradingBot.Core.
Application workflows → CryptoTradingBot.Application.
API and database integrations → CryptoTradingBot.Infrastructure.
Console/WPF/Web logic → CryptoTradingBot.Presentation.
Validate structure: After moving the code, ensure namespaces and dependencies are updated.
